# Project #2 -- Use objects to create dynamic sketch.
# Monster stalks the hero, who hunts for gold.

#### Write simple object classes for ```Gold, Hero, Dog, Monster```  
####_(then write code to accomplish other requirements described below)_

                            NOTE:  THIS PROJECT DESCRIPTION IS INCOMPLETE!
                            DO NOT USE THESE INSTRUCTION UNTIL PROJECT IS ASSIGNED.




## Project #2 -- Use objects to create a dynamic sketch, including:
+ scene with sky, grass, sun, tree, and house,  
+ a hero who chases the gold,
+ a dog that follows the hero,
+ a puppy that follows the dog, and
+ a monster that slowly chases the hero.
Add titles and a score.  
**NOTE:**  All requirements from Project #1 also apply to Project #2.  

## SCENE:
+ sky
+ sun -- moves across the sky, at a random height
+ grass (below the "horizon")
+ tree with brown trunk (rectangle above horizon) and green leaves (ellipse) 
+ house -- with roof, door, and windows

## GOLD
+ A sparkling gold nugget appears at a random position.

## HERO
+ shirt with name on it
+ pants and legs
+ arms
+ head and eyes
Hero moves toward the gold.

## DOG:
+ body (low, brown rectangle)
+ head (small rectangle at one end) with eye
+ tail (sticking up at the other end.
+ legs sticking downward, at each end.  _(animated?)_

Dog rapidly moves toward the hero.  
+ head should be at the front, tail at the back
+ _(can you animate the legs?)_ 

## PUPPY:
Puppy is a small Dog object that chases the big dog.

## MONSTER:
+ make up your own _(scary)_ shape
+ monster slowly moves toward the hero.

# Object Oriented Design and Programming
## Write simple object classes for each of the the following:
```
    class Gold { 
        //... 
    }
    class Hero { 
        //... 
    }
    class Dog { 
        //... 
    }
    class Monster { 
        //... 
    }
```

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Fork this "repo"
2. Create a new file named **`p2-lastname.java`**  
    where **lastname** is  *YOUR* last name *(first three or more letters)*
3. Write simple object classes for:  ```Gold, Hero, Dog, Monster```
4. Write Java code to accomplish the above requirements.
5. Compile and test your code.
6. Copy and paste your completed code into **`p2-lastname.java`**
